# voice-ui-agent
A voice-controlled interface powered by an AI agent. Speak naturally to perform actions like changing UI elements (e.g., "change background to blue"), and watch your voice animate through a real-time audio visualizer.

ðŸ§  The backend uses Whisper for speech recognition, a custom intent parser for understanding, and text-to-speech to respond with audio â€” all 100% free and open-source.
